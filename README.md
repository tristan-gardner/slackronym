# Modifying the stater code
- If you want to change the name of your function,
1. alter the name of the manage folder to the desired name
2. in manage/function.json, alter the route paramter, replace "manage" with new function name
3. in django_project.settings, alter the constant FUNCTION_APP_PATH, replace "manage" with the new name

- Make sure to replace the secret key value in the settings.py file
- Also connect up the db you plan to use in the settings.py file
- Feel free to rename the folder django_project to a more descriptive name
- By default on get and post methods are allowed, you can greenlight other methods by adding them in the function.json config
